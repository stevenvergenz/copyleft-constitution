======================

This project attempts to define a human organizational system (government, company, collective, call it what you will) with several interesting characteristics:

1. The system is scope-insensitive; it functions equally well for groups of dozens or millions of individuals. This is accomplished by allowing organizations following this system to join larger organizations under the same system as members (think cities to counties, or states to countries).
2. The system privileges other similarly-sized organizations with the same system: resource sharing, open borders, binding conflict arbitration, mutual defense.
3. The system requires all organizations operating within its territory to adopt the same or a compatible system.
4. The system does not protect or enshrine a set of values, except what is required to guarantee the other aspects of the system. Shared social values must be established through the democratic passage of laws that apply to all members of a particular organization.

The authors believe that such a system could out-compete other systems of government and economics, and encourage others to join. If such a system can be developed, it could eventually accomplish the dream of humankind: world peace and prosperity.
